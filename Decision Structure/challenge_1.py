# Make a Program that asks for two numbers and prints out the larger of them.

first_number = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

if first_number > second_number:
    print("The first number is larger than the second.")
else:
    print("The second number is larger than the first.")
